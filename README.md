|**The ideal sorting algorithm would have the following properties:**|
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Stable:| Equal keys aren’t reordered.|
| 2. Operates in place| requiring `O(1)` extra space.|
| 3. Worst-case | `O(n·lg(n))` ***key comparisons***.|
| 4. Worst-case | `O(n)` ***swaps***.|
| 5. Adaptive:| Speeds up to O(n) when data is nearly sorted or when there are few unique keys.

2. Body Paragraph #3 (What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm)
---------------------

1. ***Big O Notation***

|:***Time Complexity*** | :**Case**: |
|______|______|
| Worst Case Deletion | O(n) |
| Best Case Deletion | O(1) |
| Worst Case Insertion |
